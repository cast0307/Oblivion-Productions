# Daniel Castro's Portfolio
This is the final project for Web Development II

# Project Self-Reflection

## Process
During the creation of this project I tried to followed a structured process similar to the own shown in class.

1. Defining the purpose and goal of the portfolio.
2. Designing and prototyping the layout and user interface of the portfolio
3. Developing the portfolio using HTML 
4. Styling the website using Bootstrap Franework 
5. Retouching details with CSS stylesheet
6. Deploying the portfolio to a web server for public access

## Challenges & Obstacles 
- One of the main challenges I had during this project was spendings lot of time on small details that don't add much value. Given the fact that I am a very perfectionist person, I usually try to leave every detail almost perfect or as close to reality as possible. This makes, that while I try to solve the problem, I waste a lot of time on something not important instead of focusing on more difficult tasks. This is something that I have always struggled with, however moving forward, I will try to focus on the big part of the things first and fix the small details and issues after the rest is done. 

- Another challenge I faced during my development process was the different sizes and resolutions for my images. Despite trying and following previous examples and recordings, I wasn't able to make each of the images work. Moving forward, I will dive deeper into this specific matter and gain more knowledge. 

## How I overcame these challenges? 
- By working in collaboration with a friend, we were able to help each other and find different solutions to the same problem. 
- Conducting thorough testing and debugging on multiple devices and browsers
- Consulting online resources and documentation to find solutions to specific challenges
- Iterating and refining my code until I achieved the desired result

### Lessons Learned
Creating my web portfolio has been a valuable learning experience. Some of the key lessons I have learned include:

1. The importance of planning and prototyping before starting development
2. The value of using frameworks and libraries to save time and improve efficiency
3. The importance of testing and debugging to ensure a high-quality product
4. The need to stay up-to-date with best practices and emerging technologies in web development
